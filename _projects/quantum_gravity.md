Recent works of science-fiction have attributed all manner of mystical effects to black holes. But what if some of this science-fiction was in fact reality?
With insight from black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity I have explored the possibility that the universe is a hologram.
Check out this short <a href="../../assets/pdf/Is_The_Universe_a_Hologram.pdf">article</a> I wrote aimed at a public audeince.

For my Masters thesis I worked with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fay_Dowker">Professor Fay Dowker</a> on using Causal Set Theory, a theory of quantum gravity, to explain black hole entropy. For a review article I wrote about Causal Set Theory check out this short <a href="../../assets/pdf/CausalSetLiteratureReview.pdf">paper</a>.
